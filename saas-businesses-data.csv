There's also one business we're talking with right now that may become a $5k/mo customer.

Outside of lifetime deals & API customers, we have a few monthly recurring subscribers ($3.2k MRR), but we stopped offering this in October and opted only for lifetime deals as we like it better as a pricing model.

Here's why we like lifetime deals as a pricing model:
- Great cashflow: mitigates long-term risk by collecting all cash up front for an account
- Higher LTV: Since churn is quite high amongst almost all AI products, our calculations showed that the LTV of a customer is actually higher if we do a lifetime deal vs. monthly plans.
- It's a great marketing channel through AppSumo
- Feels like a great deal for the customer which results in better conversion rates.

Lastly, we offer a paid trial ($7 for 7 day trial), which is mostly there to avoid freeloaders, but also I think psychologically it is good for a user to make a micro-commitment so they actually give the software a full try. ","['Jasper', 'WriteSonic', 'Frase.io']",10

📌 ROYALTIES

A unique opportunity to be part of a subscription-based business which also earns royalties in the music field.

➡️ Music royalties represents a $40 billion+ market that is anticipated to grow 9% annually through 2030 (high level of growth is not frequently seen in other markets and industries).
➡️ Because of their nature, music royalties are a great source of consistent recurring revenue income which has shown their propensity to provide an excellent ROI.
➡️ Essentially independent of the general market volatility
➡️ There is a mass of expected regulatory changes sweeping across the US and Europe with better controls in place to protect music. These aim to rights holders for their contributions and will, in turn, increase the increasing rates of streaming revenues.
➡️ The company will also be able to generate additional revenue by monetizing Shorts videos under the upcoming revenue model on YouTube (Q2, 2023).

“I think everyone realized that publishing catalogs were assets you could finance, like a building. And the forecasts the investment banks are making for the number of streaming subscribers in the next 10 years are extraordinary. So investment bankers, hedge funds, private equity – they all look at this as an asset class.” — Martin Bandier, former CEO and chairman of Sony/ATV Music Publishing",373284.0,10000-100000,"SaaS, MRR, ARR, Subscriptions, Music, Tech, Royalty, Creator Economy , AI, Artificial Intelligence, Sound",179763,5.0,"PHP, Angular, AWS","B2C/B2B Saas generating consistent revenue by mainly three streams:

1. WordPress/Drupal/Joomla (open source) 
2. Wix/Weebly/Squarespace/Godaddy (starter solutions)
3. Hubspot/Salesforce/Sugar (CRM/marketing automation companies that are too expensive and complicated for SMBs)

Started as as digital agency in 2005, progressed into a software product by 2017 targeting enterprise. By 2019 realized we should be geared to SMBs and not call it """"software. 

SMBs don't understand software terminology. So we've begun rebranding now to cater to SMBs. Our clients leave wordpress, squarespace, wix, weebly, godaddy, etc. Also opportunity for startups - but prefer clients already profitable as they value the platform more. 

Played with pricing and been slowly building into SaaS product since. Me and my engineer only employees. No sales team yet. No marketing yet. About ready to scale now that have name and product suite. Bootstrapping at 20k+ mrr. In a few words - SMB CRM on steroids. Can do anything. But easy to onboard clients with ANY type of website problem. They need new site - we set them up and get them on recurring. Average recurring 199/mo. Have customer anywhere from 99-2000/mo. 

Also agency services with ARR such as SSL certificates, domain management, support, branding, SEO web maintenance. etc. We have not tried to push agency services so we can focus on making the platform more user friendly, efficient and scale-able. 

Owner would prefer to stay on with equity stake as knows potential is much greater if vision.
