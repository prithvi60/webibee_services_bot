Generative AI Automation Expert for Next.js AI Product Bug Fix
Posted 5 minutes ago
Worldwide
I’ve developed an AI-driven Ad creation tool that uses Next.js, Plasmic for the frontend, and is deployed on Vercel. The backend operations rely on the Make, which runs various automation flows, including Generative AI functionalities.
After the latest deployment, a critical bug has emerged in the Ad image generation flow. The tool is supposed to generate effective prompts for Midjourney to create ads using user information. However, for some users, the app inconsistently fails to generate any ads. This issue is a top priority and needs immediate resolution.
This is an urgent issue, so timely responses will be prioritized. I aim to engage a specialist as soon as possible.
